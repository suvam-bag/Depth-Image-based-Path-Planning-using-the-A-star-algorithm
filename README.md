#Introduction
Path planning is one of the most important branches of autonomous cars both in indoor and outdoor environments. The A* algorithm is a heuristic search algoorithm capable of finding the most optimized path to a destination provided a map. The map was built using the depth image of a Asus Xtion sensor.
